# Parser Lab Session 1 - Calculator

## Task
Build parser for “calculator”
- Input is arithmetic expression
- Output should be value of the expression
- Error handling is not required, but appreciated
- Minimal set of expressions:
    - Terms over natural numbers
    - with `+` and `*` and parentheses `(`, `)`

## Prerequisites
The tool used for generating the lexer and parser is [ANTLR v4](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4). To compile and run the software the following tools are needed
- Java (because ANTLR is written in Java)
- ANTLR v4 (the JAR-File can be downloaded [here](https://www.antlr.org/download.html))
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) (at least version 3.7)
- C++ compiler supporting C++17 (e.g. Apple Clang [used to develop this program], Clang, g++, MSVC)
